# AnglerRT

AnglerRT is a simple Ray Tracing engine.  
AnglerED is a optional GUI interface using [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to adjust different settings in AnglerRT.

It is roughly based on the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.


## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended, Angler is officially untested on other development environments whilst I focus on a Windows build.
I use the MinGW GCC compiler for windows. This project is untested on other compilers.

By default AnglerRT is compiled as a .lib file and linked against AnglerED.

**Downloading the repository:**  
Start by cloning the repository with  
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/botmelive/Angler.git`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.


Now you should be able to build the project in CMake.
